                  In the heart of Beijing, a young woman named Mei often strolled through Tiananmen Square, reflecting on the changing world around her. As she walked, she would gaze up at the imposing portrait of Hu Jintao, who had served as Chinaâ€™s president from 2003 to 2013. To her, he was more than a political figure; he was a symbol of a transformative era.
